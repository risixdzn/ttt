## Syntax Highlighting

TTT uses [chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma) for syntax highlighting, supporting hundreds of languages with automatic detection based on file extension.

## Bracket Matching

Matching brackets are highlighted automatically when the cursor is on a bracket character. Press **Ctrl+K M** to jump to the matching bracket.

Bracket pair colorization is also available, rendering each nesting level in a distinct color. It is off by default and can be enabled with the `editor.bracketPairColorization` setting.

## Auto Indent

New lines inherit the indentation of the previous line and gain an extra level after an open `{`, `(`, `[`, or trailing `:`. This is on by default; toggle it from the Options menu (**Auto Indent**) or with the `editor.autoIndent` setting. Turn it off for plain `noautoindent` behavior, where Enter opens a column-1 line.

Typing a closing `}`, `)`, or `]` on an otherwise-blank line dedents it one level so it lines up with its opening line. This dedent is on by default; toggle it from the Options menu (**Auto Dedent**) or with the `editor.autoDedent` setting.

## Find and Replace

- **Ctrl+F** opens the find bar with match navigation
- **Ctrl+R** opens find and replace with replace-one and replace-all
- **F3 / Shift+F3** to jump between matches

## Go to Line

Press **Ctrl+G** to open the Go to Line dialog.

## Selection and Clipboard

- **Ctrl+A** to select all
- **Ctrl+C / Ctrl+X / Ctrl+V** for copy, cut, paste with system clipboard support

## Undo and Redo

- **Ctrl+Z** to undo, **Ctrl+Y** to redo
- Uses a command-pattern undo stack for reliable history tracking

## Multi-Cursor Editing

TTT supports editing with multiple cursors simultaneously. Place cursors at multiple locations and type, delete, or insert lines. All cursors act in parallel.

### Adding Cursors

- **Ctrl+D** selects the current word (or extends the current selection) and adds a cursor at the next occurrence
- **Ctrl+K L** selects all occurrences of the current word/selection at once
- **Alt+Click** adds a cursor at the clicked position

### Removing Cursors

- **Ctrl+K U** undoes the last cursor addition
- **Escape** collapses back to a single cursor (when multiple cursors are active)

### Behavior

- Typing, backspace, delete, and enter work at all cursor positions simultaneously
- Undo/redo groups multi-cursor edits into a single action
- The status bar shows the cursor count (e.g., "3 cursors") when multiple cursors are active

## Line Operations

- **Alt+Up / Alt+Down** moves the current line (or selected lines) up or down
- **Ctrl+K K** deletes the current line
- **Ctrl+Enter** inserts a new line below the cursor
- **Ctrl+K J** joins the current line with the next line

## Toggle Comment

Press **Ctrl+/** to toggle line comments on the current line or selection.

## Code Folding

TTT supports indent-based code folding:

- **Ctrl+K [** toggles the fold at the current line
- **Ctrl+K 0** collapses all foldable regions
- **Ctrl+K 9** expands all foldable regions

## Text Transforms

These commands are available from the command palette:

- **Transform to Uppercase** / **Transform to Lowercase** / **Transform to Titlecase**
- **Sort Lines Ascending** (**Ctrl+K O**) / **Sort Lines Descending**
- **Reverse Lines**
- **Unique Lines** (remove duplicates)
- **Split Selection into Lines**

## Word Operations

- **Ctrl+Left / Ctrl+Right** moves the cursor one word left or right
- **Ctrl+Shift+Left / Ctrl+Shift+Right** selects one word left or right
- **Alt+Backspace** deletes the word to the left
- **Alt+Delete** or **Ctrl+Delete** deletes the word to the right

## Indentation

TTT supports `.editorconfig` files and picks up indent size automatically per file. It also auto-detects indentation from file content. You can manually override indentation via the status bar indent picker.

## Mouse Support

- Click to position the cursor
- Click tabs to switch files
- Drag sidebar and panel dividers to resize
- Right-click for context menus

## Line Numbers

Line numbers are shown in the gutter with current-line highlighting. The gutter style can be set to `minimal`, `compact` (default), or `extended` via the `editor.gutterStyle` setting. Toggle line numbers on or off with the `lineNumbers` setting.

## Git Blame

Inline blame info for the current line is shown in the status bar, including the author, relative time, and commit summary.

## Git Gutter

When enabled, diff indicators appear in the line number gutter showing added, modified, and removed lines compared to the last committed version. Toggle with the "Toggle Git Gutter" command in the command palette.

When a file is taller than the editor, the same changes are marked on the vertical scrollbar in the gutter colors. Marks are placed to an eighth of a cell, and even a single changed line stays visible in a long file. Set `appearance.scrollbarGlyphs` to `"legacy"` for thin line marks if your terminal or font has the Symbols for Legacy Computing glyphs. Click a mark to scroll to that change.
